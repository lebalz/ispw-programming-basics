## Installation

You will see popping up some error/information messages pointing out that some dependencies (Git, Python) are not installed on your system. To install these dependencies, run the following commands (this may take up to 5 Minutes to complete):

- View > Command Palette... > `Git2Go: Install`
    - **osx**: you may be prompted for your root password to install some dependencies
    - **windows**: you may be prompted to allow vs code running powershell with administrator privileges.
    - at the end of the installation process, you will be prompted for your Name and Email. This is needed to configure git (all your changes will then be annotated with this name&email).  
- View > Command Palette... > `Python2Go: Install`
    - **windows**: you may be prompted to allow vs code running powershell with administrator privileges.

Then restart your vs code and start using it ðŸŽ‰
